# Progetto Machine Learning
This is the Machine Learning project for the 2023/2024 year. The purpose of the project is to use Machine Learning models for a classification task and a regression task. With the first dataset, MONK, we have a classification problem, while with the larger dataset, we need to perform a linear regression task.
The project was done in a group. More information about the implementation can be found in the group **report**.
